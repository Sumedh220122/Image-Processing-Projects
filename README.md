The following repository contains all my image-processing projects which i developed while i was learning image processing.

A Brief overview of each of them is as follows:
1. **Basic-Face-Detection**: This project uses haar-cascade classifiers to identify face and various other facial features like eyes, nose, ears etc.
2. **Face-Anonymization**: This project is used for explores face-anonymization i.e hiding faces during video calls or meetings etc.
3. **Hand-Signs-detection** : This project recognizes hand-signs made during videos and translates them into text. A Random forest classifier is trained on contours extracted from hand-sign images to predict the corresponding letter.
